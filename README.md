 Mars news site

Mars Weather Facts Website

Project Requirements
Requirement 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News.
* Automated browsing (with Splinter) was used to visit the Mars news site, and the HTML code was extracted (with Beautiful Soup). 

* The titles and preview text of the news articles were scraped and extracted. 

* The scraped information was stored in the specified Python data structureâ€”specifically, a list of dictionaries.

Requirement 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data 
* The HTML table was extracted into a Pandas DataFrame. Either Pandas or Splinter and Beautiful Soup were used to scrape the data. The columns have the correct headings and data types.

* The data was analyzed to answer the following questions: 

How many months exist on Mars? 
How many Martian days' worth of data are there? 
The data was analyzed to answer the following questions, and a data visualization was created to support each answer:

Which month, on average, has the lowest temperature? The highest? 
Which month, on average, has the lowest atmospheric pressure? The highest? 
How many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year? A visual estimate within 25% was made. 
The DataFrame was exported into a CSV file.
